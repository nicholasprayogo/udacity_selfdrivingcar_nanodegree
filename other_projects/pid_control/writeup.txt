While this was a short project, I really enjoyed learning and implementing a PID controller because it is nice seeing how the car behaves with different P,I, and D coefficients. In this case, I used Kp of 0.07, Ki of 0.0005, Kd of 1.5. I tweaked the coefficients so that the proportional gain is just enough to steer the car while not too large to cause the car to move in large and uncomfortable jerks. Similarly, I set Ki to be just enough to correct for the car's CTE with time, but not too large so that it doesn't cause the car to jerk too frequently. Finally, I set Kd to be quite high to ensure that the car doesn't go too off center at every timestep, but not too high to ensure the car doesn't oscillate too much. Given more time, I am interested to apply twiddle or other parameter optimization approaches such as reinforcement learning algorithms give the controller the capability of learning the best parameters and tweaking them as it drives under different circumstances.
